# 📘 Code Rush Daily - DSA Practice

Welcome to **Code Rush Daily**! 🚀

This repository is my personal commitment to solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems **every day**. I aim to push at least **one DSA problem daily**, and sometimes more depending on my schedule and time.

## 🧠 Goal
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Stay consistent with daily coding
- Prepare for coding interviews

## 💻 Languages Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🌐 JavaScript

## 🔧 Techniques & Patterns Used
Throughout the journey, I solve problems using popular DSA patterns and strategies, including:
- Two Pointers
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Sorting & Searching
- Stack / Queue
- Recursion / Backtracking
- Binary Search
- Hashing
- Greedy & Dynamic Programming (coming soon)

## 🌍 Platforms Solved On
Problems are picked and solved from various platforms:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- Solved TCS Nqt,Prime
- Others as applicable
