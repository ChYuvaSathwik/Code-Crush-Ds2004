"""You are given a list of integers.
Your task is to insert these integers into a deque by following this rule:

If the index of the element is even (like 0, 2, 4...), insert the element at the right end of the deque using append().

If the index is odd (like 1, 3, 5...), insert the element at the left end of the deque using appendleft().

Finally, return the deque."""
