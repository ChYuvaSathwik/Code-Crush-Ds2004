You are given the height of a tree over 4 consecutive weeks (4 numbers).

You must:

Calculate the difference in height between each week.

Then based on the results:

❌ If any height is negative, return: "Not valid inputs"

✅ If any two differences are the same, return that common difference

ℹ️ If all 3 differences are different, return: "None"
