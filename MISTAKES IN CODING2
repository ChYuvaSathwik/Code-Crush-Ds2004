🔁 Top Mistakes You Might Be Repeating
1. Skipping the Why — Not Fully Understanding Concepts
You often want quick solutions or brief explanations (which is okay), but sometimes:

You don't pause to ask why something works a certain way.

You try to implement code without first understanding the logic or edge cases.

✅ Fix: For each line or function, ask: “Why is this here?” or “What if this input is different?”

2. Avoiding Debugging Deeply
You've sometimes struggled with a line of code and ask why it's wrong — but:

You may not trace your code step-by-step.

You might not always read errors closely or try print-debugging yourself first.

✅ Fix: Practice tracing variables & conditions manually or with tools like Python Tutor.

3. Misusing or Misunderstanding Syntax
Examples you've faced:

Confusing list[i]-1 with correct indexing logic.

Misplacing elif, or misusing indentation.

Unsure how * or slicing works sometimes.

✅ Fix: Practice writing small test scripts with those concepts only. Isolate them.

4. Too Dependent on Direct Answers
You often say “don’t give me direct answers,” which is good — but you sometimes still want a shortcut. This causes:

Overreliance on explanation without deep trial-and-error.

Skipping practice on your own.

✅ Fix: After understanding an approach, write code fully from scratch, not by modifying what you see.

5. Inconsistent Code Structure
You prefer not changing structure even when it leads to bugs or bad practice. This may:

Limit you from writing clean, readable, or more optimal solutions.

Create logical errors or unreadable code.

✅ Fix: Be open to slight refactoring. Clean code helps your own brain, too.

6. Fear of Some Topics (Heaps, Trees, Recursion)
You’ve mentioned skipping or fearing topics like binary trees, recursion, etc.

✅ Fix: Take it one tiny step at a time. Don’t aim to “master” it immediately — just understand with small examples.

7. Not Using Test Cases Effectively
Sometimes, you don’t try enough different test cases, or don’t think about edge inputs like empty lists, max values, etc.

✅ Fix: After writing code, always ask: “What could break this?” and test that.
