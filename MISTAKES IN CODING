Merge k Sorted Lists  
❌ Mistake 1: Used list[i]-1 instead of len(list[i])-1  
🧠 Reason: Forgot list[i] is a list, not a number  
✔️ Fix: Use len(list[i])-1 when checking end

Problem: Using heapq  
❌ Mistake: Didn’t understand tuple ordering in heap  
✔️ Fix: heapq sorts by first element in tuple (priority queue behavior)
